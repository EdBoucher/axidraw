# AxiDrawJS

## Description

This is a fork of https://github.com/ubilabs/axidraw with a few aims:

1. More flexible drawing tools, with a focus on procedural generation and matrix transforms for common operations like rotation, scaling and translation
2. Support for actual paper sizes
3. Support for both the V3 and V3/A3 AxiDraw plotters
